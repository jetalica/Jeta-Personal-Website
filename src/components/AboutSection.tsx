            My PhD research is all about turning a major environmental challenge into a sustainable solution üí°. I'm focusing on sewage sludge, which is typically seen as just waste. However, it's actually a rich source of phosphorus, a non-renewable nutrient that is absolutely essential for the fertilizers that grow our food. My project involves developing an innovative and eco-friendly process to efficiently recover this phosphorus, transforming it from a potential pollutant into a valuable resource. The ultimate goal is to create a true circular economy model ‚ôªÔ∏è, where we close the loop by taking waste, reclaiming a critical element, and creating a sustainable raw material that supports our environment and global food security.

                I'm a materials science researcher üî¨ passionate about sustainability and innovation. My work is centered on a simple but powerful idea: transforming overlooked materials‚Äîlike waste products or natural resources‚Äîinto valuable new products for industry, agriculture, and healthcare. Essentially, I find hidden value where others see waste, developing practical, eco-friendly solutions to real-world problems.

                My current PhD research puts this directly into practice by tackling a major environmental challenge: sewage sludge. Instead of treating it as a disposal problem, I see it as a rich source of resources. I'm developing an innovative process to recover phosphorus ‚ôªÔ∏è, a non-renewable nutrient that is absolutely vital for the fertilizers that grow our food. This project aims to create a true circular economy model, turning a waste management issue into a sustainable solution that protects our environment and supports global food security. This hands-on approach to creating value is a common thread throughout my work. I have experience designing advanced materials from the ground up, such as engineering next-generation nanomaterials for better dental applications, and I specialize in using eco-friendly "green chemistry" techniques, like using clean CO‚ÇÇ to isolate potent antimicrobial extracts from medicinal plants üå±. Ultimately, my work connects the dots between the lab and the real world, focusing on designing smarter systems where resources are continuously reused to build a more sustainable future. üí°
